# Caching Algorithms Project

## Project Overview

This project involves implementing different caching algorithms in Python. The purpose is to understand and implement various cache replacement policies, each with its own way of managing stored data.

### Caching Algorithms Covered

1. **Basic Cache**: A basic caching system with no size limit.
2. **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: Removes the oldest item from the cache when the limit is reached.
3. **LIFO (Last In, First Out)**: Removes the most recently added item when the limit is reached.
4. **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Removes the least recently accessed item when the limit is reached.
5. **MRU (Most Recently Used)**: Removes the most recently accessed item when the limit is reached.

## Project Requirements

- **Python Version**: 3.7
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- **File Formatting**: All Python files must end with a newline and start with the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- **Coding Style**: Follow the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.5).
- **Documentation**: 
  - All modules, classes, and functions should have proper documentation.
  - Documentation should provide a clear explanation of the purpose of each component.
